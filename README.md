========

This is a library for developing pipelines in Python.

To use the package locally, simply `pip install .` in your python virtualenv.

For development, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and you can do the following:

* Build and read the docs:

        python ./setup.py build_sphinx
        open docs/_build/html/index.html


* Work on the library or checkout the examples:

        python ./setup.py develop

* Run the tests:

        python ./setup.py test
